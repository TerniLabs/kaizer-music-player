### Features

- Search songs from multiple providers (Atlas, Orion, Helios, and Nyx) from a single unified interface.
- Stream tracks with provider-aware playback status (including local playback when a track is already downloaded).
- Create, manage, and delete playlists with support for custom covers and reusable dialog-driven flows.
- Browse playlists in both box and row layouts, with per-playlist track search and smooth page transitions.
- Download tracks manually or enable **Download while streaming** for automatic offline saving.
- Manage local downloads in a dedicated table view with multi-select actions (add to playlist, delete, and bulk operations).
- Use a persistent local SQLite database (Drizzle ORM) for playlists, downloads, settings, and app state snapshots.
- Configure preferred server/provider, storage capacity limits, update behavior, and server health checks from Settings.
